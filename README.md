The purpose of this project is to investigate and analyze the weather data of a specific location over the span of four centuries. This was done by sub-analyzing the given data, which can be used to identify weather patterns and potentially predict future climate changes under given conditions. Examples of this include analyzing weather by the century, comparing time periods synchronously, and finding the maximum and minimum temperatures within a given period. GNUPlot was used to graphically represent the given data, which is useful to visualize weather patterns and identify any temperature abnormalities that are present, as well as easy to comprehend. 

The intended audience for this project are weather researchers, as they can take the given data to generate future short-term and long-term trends and temperature patterns. This may include periods of warmer and cooler temperatures. Weather reporters/meteorologists will also find this information useful, as it will be passed onto them to relate to the public on future climate predictions.
